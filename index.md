# About Me


*Hi! I'm a backpacker who loves trees and forests, and a rookie engineer eager to conquer algorithms.*
*I enjoy the process of solving algorithmic problems. If the problem is interesting, I'll work on it until it's solved, no matter how long it takes.*
*Currently, I'm focusing on becoming a data engineer and am gaining various experiences to achieve this goal.*
*I am working on several personal projects such as building data pipelines and creating visualizations to hone my data engineering skills.*
*Additionally, I actively participate in coding communities, where I both share my knowledge and learn from the experiences of others.*
*In particular, I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology, particularly in data engineering and machine learning.*
*My ultimate goal is to contribute to impactful projects that leverage data to drive meaningful insights and decisions.*
