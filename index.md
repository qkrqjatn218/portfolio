# About Me


*Hello. I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Applied Mathematics at Hanyang University ERICA Campus, and I expect to graduate in August 2024. I love listening to classical piano music as well as movie soundtracks, and I also enjoy playing the piano.*

*I aim to be the person who develops an industry providing personalized music through services like practical AI compositions and music covers.*

*Currently, my field of study revolves around generative models, and my current project involves utilizing a text-to-image model to generate a dataset for order picking task.*

*My research interests include computer-based music composition and production, with a specific focus on tasks such as sound synthesis, symbolic music generation, and text-to-music. I am also interested in areas such as representation learning.*
