# About Me


*Hello. I am an undergraduate student in the Department of Applied Mathematics at Hanyang University ERICA Campus (expected to graduate in August 2024). I love classical piano music and movie music and enjoy playing the piano. My piano skills are stuck at about Czerny 100, but,,, I'm constantly working on it.*

*My goal is to be the person who develops an industry that provides personalized music by modeling services such as practical AI compositions or music covers.*

*My current field of study is generative models, and I am working on a project to generate a training dataset for a task through a text to image model.*

*My research interests include computer-based music composition and production, with particular interest in tasks such as sound synthesis, symbolic music generation, and text to music. I am also interested in areas such as representation learning.*
